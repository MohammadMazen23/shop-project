    q:"Is Verdera a medical treatment or a steroid replacement?",
    a:'Verdera is a supportive skincare line designed to soothe itch, support the skin barrier, and help manage flare-ups, but it is not a medicine and does not replace prescribed treatments (like topical steroids or prescription creams). It can be used alongside a dermatologist’s plan.'

{
    q:"How do probiotics/microbiome products help eczema?",
    a:'Eczema skin often has a weakened barrier and an imbalanced skin microbiome. Our probiotic-inspired approach helps by supporting a healthier skin environment, reducing irritation triggers, and strengthening the barrier so skin becomes less reactive over time.'
},
{
    q:"Is it safe for very sensitive skin? Does it burn or sting?",
    a:'Our formulas are made for eczema-prone, sensitive skin—gentle, non-stripping, and designed for long-term use. We recommend a patch test first, especially during severe flares, because every eczema patient reacts differently.'
},
{
    q:"How do I use the kit and when will I see results?",
    a:'Use the products as a routine: daily barrier support + targeted relief during flare-ups. Many people feel soothing quickly (especially for itch), while barrier improvement typically takes consistent use over days to weeks. For best results, stay consistent and avoid known triggers.'
},
{
    q:"Can I use Verdera on my face/scalp and for kids?",
    a:'Verdera is designed for eczema-prone skin and scalp, including sensitive areas. For children, pregnancy, or very reactive skin, we recommend patch testing first and checking with a dermatologist—especially if the eczema is severe or the skin is broken/open.'
